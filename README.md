<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<p align="left">
A recommendation system is a type of information filtering system which attempts to predict the 
preferences of a user, and make suggests based on these preferences. There are a wide variety of 
applications for recommendation systems. These have become increasingly popular over the last few 
years and are now utilized in most online platforms that we use. The content of such platforms varies 
from movies, music, books and videos, to friends and stories on social media platforms, to products on 
e-commerce websites, to people on professional and dating websites, to search results returned on 
Google. Often, these systems are able to collect information about a users choices, and can use this 
information to improve their suggestions in the future. In the browser, if we search movie name it will 
give similar movies related to that input movie. This is done by three recommendation engine such as 
popular based recommendation engine, content-based recommendation engine, collaborative filtering based recommendation engine.</p>
<p align="left">
The popular based recommendation engine is nothing but trending list on YouTube, Netflix, etc. They 
will keep on tracking the video views and update the on-trending list. The content-based 
recommendation engine is taking the input from the user and give a similar rank list based on the 
content related to the input movie. In this project, the content-based recommendation engine is used. 
The collaborative filtering-based recommendation engine is first search the similar user based on their 
activity and behavior and if the first user and second user have seen the same movie and if the first 
user has seen the new movie but if the second user not. It recommends new movies to a second user and 
vice-versa</p>

<!-- Algo -->
## User-Based Collaborative Filtering

Imagine that we want to recommend a movie to our friend Stanley. We could assume that similar people will have similar taste. Suppose that me and Stanley have seen the same movies, and we rated them all almost identically. But Stanley hasn‚Äôt seen ‚ÄòThe Godfather: Part II‚Äô and I did. If I love that movie, it sounds logical to think that he will too. With that, we have created an artificial rating based on our similarity.

Well, UB-CF uses that logic and recommends items by finding similar users to the active user (to whom we are trying to recommend a movie). A specific application of this is the user-based Nearest Neighbor algorithm. This algorithm needs two tasks:

1.Find the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) to the user a, using a similarity function w to measure the distance between each pair of users:

2.Predict the rating that user a will give to all items the k neighbors have consumed but a has not. We Look for the item j with the best predicted rating.

In other words, we are creating a User-Item Matrix, predicting the ratings on items the active user has not see, based on the other similar users. This technique is memory-based.
